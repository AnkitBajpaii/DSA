    /* Free Cars
    Problem Description
Given two arrays, A and B of size N. A[i] represents the time by which you can buy the ith car without paying any money.

B[i] represents the profit you can earn by buying the ith car. It takes 1 minute to buy a car, so you can only buy the ith car when the current time <= A[i] - 1.

Your task is to find the maximum profit one can earn by buying cars considering that you can only buy one car at a time.

NOTE:

You can start buying from time = 0.
Return your answer modulo 109 + 7.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
0 <= B[i] <= 109



Input Format
The first argument is an integer array A represents the deadline for buying the cars.
The second argument is an integer array B represents the profit obtained after buying the cars.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the maximum profit you can earn.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 3, 2, 3, 3]
 B = [5, 6, 1, 3, 9]
Input 2:

 A = [3, 8, 7, 5]
 B = [3, 1, 7, 19]


Example Output
Output 1:

 20
Output 2:

 30


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 At time 0, buy car with profit 5.
 At time 1, buy car with profit 6.
 At time 2, buy car with profit 9.
 At time = 3 or after , you can't buy any car, as there is no car with deadline >= 4.
 So, total profit that one can earn is 20.
Explanation 2:

 At time 0, buy car with profit 3.
 At time 1, buy car with profit 1.
 At time 2, buy car with profit 7.
 At time 3, buy car with profit 19.
 We are able to buy all cars within their deadline. So, total profit that one can earn is 30.

    /* Distribute Candy
    Problem Description
N children are standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum number of candies you must give?

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The candidate with 1 rating gets 1 candy and candidate with rating 2 cannot get 1 candy as 1 is its neighbor.

    /* Seats
    Problem Description
There is a row of seats represented by string A. Assume that it contains N seats adjacent to each other.
There is a group of people who are already seated in that row randomly. i.e. some are sitting together & some are scattered.

An occupied seat is marked with a character 'x' and an unoccupied seat is marked with a dot ('.')

Now your target is to make the whole group sit together i.e. next to each other, without having any vacant seat between them in such a way that the total number of hops or jumps to move them should be minimum.

In one jump a person can move to the adjacent seat (if available).

NOTE: 1. Return your answer modulo 107 + 3.



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 1000000

Input Format
The first and only argument is a string A of size N.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the minimum number of jumps required.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = "....x..xx...x.."
Input 2:

 A = "....xxx"


Example Output
Output 1:

 5
Output 2:

 0


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Here is the row having 15 seats represented by the String (0, 1, 2, 3, ......... , 14) 
                 . . . . x . . x x . . . x . . 
 Now to make them sit together one of approaches is -
                 . . . . . . x x x x . . . . .
 Steps To achieve this:
 1) Move the person sitting at 4th index to 6th index: Number of jumps by him =   (6 - 4) = 2
 2) Bring the person sitting at 12th index to 9th index: Number of jumps by him = (12 - 9) = 3
 So, total number of jumps made: 2 + 3 = 5 which is the minimum possible.

 If we other ways to make them sit together but the number of jumps will exceed 5 and that will not be minimum.
 
Explanation 2:

 They are already together. So, the cost is zero.

The local ship renting service has a special rate plan:

It is up to a passenger to choose a ship.
If the chosen ship has X (X > 0) vacant places at the given moment, then the ticket for such a ship costs X.
The passengers buy tickets in turn, the first person in the queue goes first, then the second one, and so on up to A-th person.

Second arugument is a integer B deonting the number of ships.
Third argument is an integer array C of size B where C[i] denotes the number of empty seats in the i-th ship before the ticket office starts selling tickets.



Output Format

Example Output
Output 1:

Example Explanation
Explantion 1:

 Maximum money can be earned if the passenger choose : 2(first ship) + 1(first ship) + 1(second ship) + 1(third ship).
 So, the cost will be 5.
 Minimum money can be earned if the passenger choose : 1(senocd ship) + 2(first ship) + 1(first ship) + 1(third ship).
 So, the cost will be 5.
Explanation 2:

 Maximum money can be earned if the passenger choose : 2(first ship) + 2(second ship) + 2(third ship) + 1(first ship).
 So, the cost will be 7.
 Minimum money can be earned if the passenger choose : 2(senocd ship) + 2(first ship) + 1(first ship) + 1(second ship).
