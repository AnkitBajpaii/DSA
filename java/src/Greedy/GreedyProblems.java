    /* Free Cars
    Problem Description
Given two arrays, A and B of size N. A[i] represents the time by which you can buy the ith car without paying any money.

B[i] represents the profit you can earn by buying the ith car. It takes 1 minute to buy a car, so you can only buy the ith car when the current time <= A[i] - 1.

Your task is to find the maximum profit one can earn by buying cars considering that you can only buy one car at a time.

NOTE:

You can start buying from time = 0.
Return your answer modulo 109 + 7.


Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
1 <= A[i] <= 109
0 <= B[i] <= 109



Input Format
The first argument is an integer array A represents the deadline for buying the cars.
The second argument is an integer array B represents the profit obtained after buying the cars.



Output Format
Return an integer denoting the maximum profit you can earn.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 3, 2, 3, 3]
 B = [5, 6, 1, 3, 9]
Input 2:

 A = [3, 8, 7, 5]
 B = [3, 1, 7, 19]


Example Output
Output 1:

 20
Output 2:

 30


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 At time 0, buy car with profit 5.
 At time 1, buy car with profit 6.
 At time 2, buy car with profit 9.
 At time = 3 or after , you can't buy any car, as there is no car with deadline >= 4.
 So, total profit that one can earn is 20.
Explanation 2:

 At time 0, buy car with profit 3.
 At time 1, buy car with profit 1.
 At time 2, buy car with profit 7.
 At time 3, buy car with profit 19.
 We are able to buy all cars within their deadline. So, total profit that one can earn is 30.

    /* Distribute Candy
    Problem Description
N children are standing in a line. Each child is assigned a rating value.

You are giving candies to these children subjected to the following requirements:

Each child must have at least one candy.
Children with a higher rating get more candies than their neighbors.
What is the minimum number of candies you must give?



Problem Constraints
1 <= N <= 105
-109 <= A[i] <= 109



Input Format
The first and only argument is an integer array A representing the rating of children.



Output Format
Return an integer representing the minimum candies to be given.



Example Input
Input 1:

 A = [1, 2]
Input 2:

 A = [1, 5, 2, 1]


Example Output
Output 1:

 3
Output 2:

 7


Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 The candidate with 1 rating gets 1 candy and candidate with rating 2 cannot get 1 candy as 1 is its neighbor. 
 So rating 2 candidate gets 2 candies. In total, 2 + 1 = 3 candies need to be given out.

N Mice and N holes are placed in a straight line. Each hole can accommodate only one mouse.

The positions of Mice are denoted by array A, and the position of holes is denoted by array B.

A mouse can stay at his position, move one step right from x to x + 1, or move one step left from x to x âˆ’ 1. Any of these moves consume 1 minute.

Assign mice to holes so that the time when the last mouse gets inside a hole is minimized.

Input 2:

 A = [-2]
 B = [-6]


Example Output
Output 1:

 2
Output 2:

Example Explanation
Explanation 1:

 Assign the mouse at position (-4 to -2), (2 to 0) and (3 to 4).
 The number of moves required will be 2, 2 and 1 respectively.
 So, the time taken will be 2.
Explanation 2:

 Assign the mouse at position -2 to -6.
 The number of moves required will be 4.
 So, the time taken will be 4.
