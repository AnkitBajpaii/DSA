# Problems on Recursion

- Recursive Linear Search in an array

- Check if string is Palindrome.

- Find sum of digit of a number using recursion.

- Given a rope of length n, you need to find maximum number of pieces you can make such that length of every piece is in set {a,b,c} for given three values a, b, c.

- Given a string print all subsets of it(in any order).

- Tower of Hanoi is a mathematical puzzle where we have three rods and n disks.The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another rod, obeying the following simple rules:
1) Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2) Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost disk on a stack.
3) No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

- Josephus problem 
There are n people standing in a circle waiting to be executed. The counting out begins at
some point in the circle and proceeds around the circle in a fixed direction. In each step, a
certain number of people are skipped and the next person is executed. The elimination proceeds
around the circle (which is becoming smaller and smaller as the executed people are removed),
until only the last person remains, who is given freedom. Given the total number of persons n
and a number k which indicates that k-1 persons are skipped and kth person is killed in circle.
The task is to choose the place in the initial circle so that you are the last one remaining and
so survive.

- Subset Sum Problem
Given an array and a sum, find count of subsets of this array, whose sum equals given sum.

- Generate all Permutations of a string.

- Find nth Fibonacci Number.

- Possible words from phone digit.
