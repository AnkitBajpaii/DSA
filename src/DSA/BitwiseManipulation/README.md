# Problems on Bitwise operator

- Given a number N, check if it's Kth bit (from right side) is set or not.

- Given a number N, count how many bits are set.

- Given an umber N, find if it is a power of 2.

- Given an array, where all number appear even number of times except one number, which appear odd nmber of time.  Find this odd appearing number.

- Given an array on N numbers, that has values in range [1.. N+1]. Every number appears exactly once, hence one number is missing.Find the missing number.

- Given an array A of size n, all the elements in array appear even number of times, except two numbers which appearch odd number of time.Find the two numbers which appear odd number of times.

- Generate all subset of given string.

- Given an integer an N, The task is to print the position of first set bit found from right side in the binary representation of the number.

- Given two numbers M and N, The task is to find the position of rightmost different bit in
binary representation of numbers.

- You are given two numbers A and B. Write a program to count number of bits needed to be flipped to convert A to B.

- Given a number N.  The task is to check whether it is sparse or not. A number is said to be a sparse number if no two or more consecutive bits are set  in the binary representation.

- Given a number N. The task is to find the length of the longest consecutive 1s in its binary representation.

- Given an unsigned integer N. The task is to swap all odd bits with even bits. For example, if the given number is 23 (00010111), it should be converted to 43(00101011). Here, every even position bit is swapped with adjacent bit on right side and every odd position bit is swapped with adjacent on left side.

- Given a number N, find the most significant set bit in the given number
