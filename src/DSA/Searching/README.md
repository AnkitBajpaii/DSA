# Problems on Searching

- Binary Search - Recursive & Iterative implementation.

- Find First occurence of a number in a sorted array.

- Find Last occurence of a number in a sorted array.

- Find number of times element is repeating in a sorted array.

- Count numbers of 1 in a binary sorted array.

- Given infinite sized sorted array, and an element x, find if x is present in array or not.

- Given sorted and rotated array of distinct elements, and a key x, find if x is present in the array or not.

-Peak Element, i.e any number which is not less than its neighbour.

- Median of two sorted arrays

- Majority Element

- Given an unsorted array of size n. Array elements are in the range from 1 to n. One number from set {1, 2, â€¦n} is missing and one number occurs twice in the array. Our task is to find these two numbers.

- Given a sorted array arr[] of size N without duplicates, and given a value x. Find the floor of x in given array. Floor of x is defined as the largest element K in arr[] such that K is smaller than or equal to x.

- Given an array A  which is sorted and contains N distinct elements. Also, this array is rotated at some unknown point. The task is to find the minimum element in it. 

- You are given an array arr[] of N integers including 0. The task is to find the smallest positive number missing from the array.

Two Pointer approach:
- Given a sorted array, Find a pair with given sum.

- Find triplet in an array with given sum X.

- Count pairs with given sum.

- Count triplets with given sum.

- Check for pythagoras triplets in array. a^2 + b^2 = c^2
